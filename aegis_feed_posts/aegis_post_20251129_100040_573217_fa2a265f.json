    "body": "The claim suggests that Dubai's roads are \"remarkably free of dust\" despite its desert environment, prompting curiosity about how this is achieved. This notion, however, is a common misconception. While Dubai is known for its modern infrastructure and high standards of cleanliness in many public areas, it is fundamentally a city located in a desert. Dust and sand are inherent parts of the environment. Visitors and residents will attest that dust accumulation on vehicles and surfaces, especially after wind, is a regular occurrence. The city employs extensive street cleaning and maintenance efforts, like many major cities, but it cannot entirely negate the presence of desert dust. Therefore, the premise that Dubai's roads are \"remarkably free of dust\" is an overstatement and not entirely accurate.",
