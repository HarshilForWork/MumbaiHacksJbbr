    "body": "The claim highlights an individual's stagnant salary over three years, despite acquiring new skills and their country experiencing high GDP growth. While personal financial experiences are valid, linking individual salary stagnation directly as a contradiction to national GDP growth is an oversimplification. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the total economic output of a country, and while healthy GDP growth can signal a stronger economy, it doesn't automatically translate into immediate or uniform wage increases for all individuals. Factors like inflation, industry-specific conditions, job market competition, company-specific performance, and global economic trends can all impact individual salaries. Furthermore, this claim is an unverified personal anecdote without specific details about the individual, their industry, or the country, making it impossible to evaluate its broader economic implications or if it represents a widespread trend.",

Source 1 (BBC, 2025/11/13) provides general context on how 'economic growth matters because it affects things like pay increases.' Source 2 (PBS, 2018/10/26) mentions 'Wages are starting to tick up' in the context of GDP growth, and Source 3 (BBC, 2020/11/03) cites 'real wage increases of up to 2.4%' in the US. These general discussions of wages and GDP do not provide any evidence for the specific individual's stagnant salary, acquired skills, or job-seeking efforts, nor do they confirm the 'three years' timeframe or the specific country implied by the claim. In fact, some snippets suggest the opposite of stagnant wages.",
