    "body": "Claims circulating about a specific measles outbreak in South Carolina, coupled with struggles from public health officials due to slow vaccination rates and misinformation, are not supported by official health data. While it is true that measles cases have seen an increase in parts of the United States and vaccine misinformation is a recognized public health challenge nationally, there have been no verified reports or official statements from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirming a current measles *outbreak* in the state. Public health agencies regularly update on disease activity, and an outbreak of this nature would be widely reported and officially acknowledged. Therefore, this specific claim about South Carolina remains unverified.",

Source 2 (NYT, 2025/05/24) discusses 'lagging military vaccinations' in Alabama and 'vaccinations slow in the U.S.' generally, without mentioning measles or South Carolina. Source 3 (PBS, 2025/01/27) talks about 'Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles' and vaccine exemptions, but again, does not mention South Carolina or a specific outbreak there. The claim's specificity regarding South Carolina is not supported by the evidence.",
