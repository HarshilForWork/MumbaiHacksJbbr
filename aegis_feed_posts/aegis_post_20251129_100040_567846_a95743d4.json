    "body": "Reports alleging the FBI is spending nearly $1 million in overtime specifically to redact Jeffrey Epstein's files and flag mentions of Trump during the review process lack credible evidence. While the process of reviewing and releasing sensitive documents, like those related to the Epstein case, can be resource-intensive and involve extensive redactions, there is no verified information from official sources or reputable news organizations confirming these specific expenditures or the alleged directive to flag mentions of any particular individual like Trump. Claims of such specific financial outlays and targeted redaction protocols would require official statements from the FBI or documented leaks corroborated by multiple independent sources. Without such substantiation, these claims remain unverified and should be regarded with skepticism.",
