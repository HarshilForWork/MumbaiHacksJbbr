    "body": "The claim states that a specific flyover repair is of such poor quality that its author believes it makes their country appear to be an \"international joke.\" This is an unverified anecdotal opinion. While concerns about infrastructure quality and public works are valid in many countries, this claim lacks crucial details such as the specific flyover's location, the country in question, or any objective assessment or report confirming the poor quality of the repair. Without such specific, verifiable information, this remains a subjective opinion rather than a substantiated fact. Generalizing a country's reputation based on an unverified single infrastructure project is an overstatement and lacks evidence.",

Source 3 (CBC, 2025/01/25) discusses Toronto's capital budget for 'improvements to city maintenance.' None of these address a specific flyover, its poor quality, an author's scathing criticism, or the notion of a country becoming an 'international joke' due to it.
